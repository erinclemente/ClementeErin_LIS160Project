<h1>DreamSpace: A Database for Dreams</h1><br/>
<p>Welcome! This little digital space was created by Erin Clemente as a final project for her LIS 160 class. The assignment was to make a database program with CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), designed to the students' liking!<br/><br/> Erin has a passion for journaling. She keeps journals for different things- everyday events, book reviews, and even dreams! For this project, she wanted to incorporate her dream journals into a database.<br/><br/>Dreams are fleeting! <br/><br/>Here in DreamSpace, you can jot down your dreams- DreamDocs as we call them, and come back for them later. Whether it's to psychoanalyze yourself or have a good laugh, DreamSpace holds those little films you've had in your sleep! </p><br/>
