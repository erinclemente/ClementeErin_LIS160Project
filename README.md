"""
Welcome! This little digital space was created by Erin Clemente as a final project for her LIS 160 class. The assignment was to make a database program with CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, and Delete), designed to the students' liking!

Erin has a passion for journaling. She keeps journals for different things- everyday events, book reviews, and even dreams! For this project, she wanted to incorporate her dream journals into a database.

Dreams are fleeting!

Here in DreamSpace, you can jot down your dreams- DreamDocs as we call them, and come back for them later. Whether it's to psychoanalyze yourself or have a good laugh, DreamSpace holds those little films you've had in your sleep!"""
